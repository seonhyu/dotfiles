Vim Mode Next [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bronson/vim-mode-next.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bronson/vim-mode-next)\n\nInspired by the [linux-next branch](https://lwn.net/Articles/289013/), vim-mode-next is\nan integration area for mostly-finished [vim-mode pull requests](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pulls).\n\n\n## Installing\n\nFirst, disable vim-mode and restart Atom.  vim-mode and vim-mode-next are, unsurprisingly, incompatible.\n\nThen, install vim-mode-next as you would any other Atom package.\n\n\n## Status\n\nThese pull requests are merged but not in vim-mode yet.\n\n* [#568](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/568) cursor motion stops and restarts insert mode\n* [#573](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/573) add replace mode!!\n* [#591](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/591) yank should not scroll\n* [#609](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/609) allow inserting with a count and changing count when

[#767](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/767) harmonize selection directions (reversion) on `o`\n* [#770](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/770) use onDidChangeCursorPosition to keep cursor in line\n* [#774](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/774) cancel the c operator when a motion doesn't match\n* [#777](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/777) hide command input field better\n*

vertical/horizontal split key bindings to tree-view\n* [#776](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/776) hide input outline (777 looks like a better pr)\n\n\n## Interesting Packages\n\nConsider installing these packages to provide even more Vim finger-feel:\n\n* [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode) to provide the start of a working command line.\n* [cursor-history](https://atom.io/packages/cursor-history) implements ctrl-i/ctrl-o navigation.\n* [vim-surround](https://atom.io/packages/vim-surround) starts implementing\n  [tpope's plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround).\n* [open-this](https://atom.io/packages/open-this) may have some functionality that\n  [#727](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/727) doesn't.\n\n\n## Interesting Ideas\n\nWhy restrict your vim-mode experience to the text buffer?\n\n* [#686](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/686) add vertical/horizontal split key bindings to tree-view\n* [#745](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/745) Make `j` and `k` navigate the fuzzy finder and search results\n\n\n#### vim-mode-next Branches\n\nThe [ready branch](https://github.com/bronson/vim-mode-next/commits/ready)\nis where the action is.  It contains the the raw pull requests and\nconflict resolutions.\n\nThe [master branch](https://github.com/bronson/vim-mode-next/commits/master)\nincludes the latest ready branch plus additional commits specific to vim-mode-next\n(like this README).  Unlike every other git repository out there,\nthe master branch is completely uninteresting.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bronson/vim-mode-next/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bronson/vim-mode-next","_id":"vim-mode-next@0.55.4","_shasum":"9b121e4fce5700dc1dde08bac7b8ff94c7770857","_resolved":"file:../d-115621-50427-12b0xck/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115621-50427-12b0xck/package.tgz"}
